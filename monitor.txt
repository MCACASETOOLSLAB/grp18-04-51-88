MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION

PROBLEM: READER- WRITER PROBLEM
Motivation:  Consider a shared database
Two classes of users:
Îù	Readers ÎíÎñ never modify database
Îù	Writers ÎíÎñ read and modify database

Correctness Constraints:
Îù	Readers can access database when no writers
Îù	Writers can access database when no readers or writers
Îù	Only one thread manipulates state variables at a time

Basic structure of a solution:
Îù	Reader()
   Wait until no writers
      Access data base
         Check out ÎíÎñ wake up a waiting writer
	 Îù	Writer()
	    Wait until no active readers or writers
	       Access database
	          Check out ÎíÎñ wake up waiting readers or writer

		  Language used:  HTML and JavaScript
		  WORKING:
		  In this problem of reader writer IÎéÎ÷m using three readers and four writers accessing a database. There is a critical section where writer can write something or can apply quires on database. There is one common lock for both reader and writer where condition is checked. If the condition is true then the will be open and they can access the data but one at a time. And if condition is false then reader and writer will wait in their corresponding waiting queues.   
		  Conditions:
		  Îù	A writer can enter if there are no other active writers and no readers are waiting
		  Îù	A reader can enter if there are no writers active or waiting
		  Îù	When a writer finishes, it checks to see if any readers are waiting if so, it lets one of them enter that one will let the next one enter, etcÎíÎõ
		  Îù	Similarly, when a reader finishes, if it was the last reader, it lets a writer in (if any is there)
