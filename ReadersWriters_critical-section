The R-W problem is another classic problem for which design of synchronization and concurrency mechanisms can be tested.  

 Critical Section is the file or shared resource.
    There is a data area that is shared among a number of processes.
    Any number of readers may simultaneously write to the data area.
    Only one writer at a time may write to the data area.
    If a writer is writing to the data area, no reader may read it.
    If there is at least one reader reading the data area, no writer may write to it.
    Readers only read and writers only write
    A process that reads and writes to a data area must be considered a writer (consider producer or consumer)
