==============
 a software that will serve as an interactive demonstration (e - learning) of the process synchronization problem using
 semaphores, busy waiting, spinlocks, monitors, critical section,etc.
 
 
 Language used :  Html,javascript
 
 Resorce Required :Best Viewed and work in Crome Web browser
 
 
 critical_section_problem_working:   When we click writer to start and the reader to start ,both will start thier work.
 
 
 Semaphore_with_busy_waiting: When we start writer to write by clicking once on wait it will start and write in the textarea
 and during this if we start reader also by clicking once on wait it will not go to text area it keeps checking whether writer 
 moved by pressing a signal button or not.The same with reader is reading and writer is waiting then it will also a busy wait
 and since it keeps checking or spinning around the textarea or critical section ,it is known as spin lock.
 
 Semaphore_without_busy_waiting:  In this ig a reader is reading and if we start writer then it will not start.It goes in the 
 blocked state and if reader move from critical section by pressing signal then we have to wake up writer by pressing wake_up
 button near by it and vice versa.
 
 Monitor: In this there are three readers and two writers,one reader's waiting queue,one writer's waiting queue.There is a critical section 
 in which shared data values of database will be changed which is a textbox.There is a lock which is used to check the conditions whether the readers or writer 
 can  be enter in the critical section.There are arrows which shows the direction of the reader/writer.
